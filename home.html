                            <p>Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official.
                                Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems, roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.
                                National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.

Vehicles with modified or aftermarket fuel tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet Safety Level 2 Standards for driver clothing.

The roll bar must be designed to withstand compression forces resulting from the weight of the car coming down on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting from the car skidding along the ground on the roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is to protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over. Roll bars must meet the following criteria:

Padding meeting SFI spec 45.1 or FIA 8857-2001 is strongly recommended.

The following minimum sizes are required and are based upon the weight of the car without the driver. Dimensions are nominal; 0.010-inch variation in wall thickness is allowed.

                                                        <li>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE 1010, 1020, 1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16, existing ERW tubing is acceptable.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration. Craters should be filled to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01 inch deep.

                                                        <li>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction with the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to prevent lateral distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing the diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable), there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In such situations, the installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.

If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent mounting, and at least two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope section must be at least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop.

The important consideration is that the load be distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness must be used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together.

A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for bolted mounting plates.

                                            <p>It is intended that Safety Level 3 be similar to that of SCCA Road Racing. Vehicles of motorsports-specific construction are required to meet these specifications. For National Time Trial Events, vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and competing on tires without DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.<br>
                                                All Safety Level 3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, plus the inclusion of a roll cage compliant with specifications listed here. A roll cage consists of the main hoop, front hoop, side protection, and braces as specified in these Rules.<br>
                                                These specifications apply to all vehicles other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19. Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved rollover structure or comply with the following specifications.<br>
                                                Please see <a href="#">SCCA General Competition Rules</a> section 9.4 for diagrams and illustrations.

On the passenger side of the car, the hoop must be at least as high as the top of the rear corner of the door. The main hoop must be high enough that a straight line drawn from the top of the main hoop to the top of the front hoop would pass over the driver’s helmet and steering wheel when the driver is seated in the normal driving position. Additionally, the top of the main hoop must be at least 2 inches above the driver’s helmet.

The brace shall either be in the plane of the main hoop or extend from the top of one rear brace to the bottom of the opposite rear brace. Automobiles with mid-mounted engines can have the lower mounting point attach to the frame of the automobile within 6 inches of the main hoop. In the case of braces in the plane of the main hoop, the brace must span at least 50% of the width of the main hoop, and at least 75% of the height of the main hoop. In convertible vehicles with a production line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.

If a double-diagonal “X” brace is used in the plane of the main hoop, a half-width horizontal brace may be used behind the driver’s seat to mount the seat back and shoulder harness.

                                                        <li>Cars must have two (2) braces extending to the rear from the main hoop and attaching to the frame or chassis. Braces must be attached as near as possible to the top of the main hoop (not more than 6 inches below the top), and at an included angle of at least 30 degrees.

It is recommended that the front and rear braces attach to the main hoop as close as possible to each other.

This installation design must incorporate a diagonal bar connecting the top of the main hoop to the lower front passenger side mounting point (Petty bar). Alternatively, the rear window may be removed and a clear, LEXAN™ replacement installed. The rear cage braces may pass through this replacement window and through the engine cover or bodywork to allow connection to the frame or unibody.

Instead of a single front hoop, two side hoops (down tubes) may be used. Alternatively, a top “halo” hoop following the roof line from the main hoop to the windshield with forward down tubes following the A-pillars to the floor may be used. Regardless of which one of the two approved tubing configurations, there shall be a tube connecting the two A-pillar tubes at the top of the windshield.
